    {\cventry{Sep 2022 -- Mar 2023}{Cloud Networks Researcher}{Advanced Network Architecures Lab, UPC Barcelona}{}{}{%\vspace{3pt} 
    \begin{itemize} 
    \item Analysed reinforcement learning based resource sharing, offloading and allocation for cloud-edge systems.
    \item Developed an approximation for a Mixed-Integer Optimal Matching Algorithm for resource allocation to significantly reduce execution time while achieving similar performance levels.
    \end{itemize}

    {\cventry{Oct 2021 -- Sep 2022}{Graduate Research Assistant}{Law, Economics, and Data Science Group, ETH Zurich}{}{}{%\vspace{3pt} 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Research Assistant to Professor Dr. Elliott Ash and worked on improving semantic labelling for text corpora using newer NLP models, sentence simplification and clustering for topic modelling.
    \item Worked on paraphrase mining to determine clusters of similar narratives in legal corpora and use NLP models to capture underlying narratives in meat policy documents to analyse political discourse.
    \end{itemize}

    {\cventry{May 2019 -- July 2019}{Software Development Intern}{Capgemini Engineering}{}{}{%\vspace{3pt} 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Developed a K-Shortest Path Searching algorithm for ONOS based Software Defined Layer 2 VPNs.
    \item Algorithm was subject to dynamic constraints of network resources (e.g.required edges, vertices etc.) to be used for path calculation.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item  Worked on a machine learning algorithm to predict the App Engine's appropriate display screen based on the customer's past experiences.
    \item  Developed an automation script for generating SVG cards for the App Engine's game front end and an address verification tool using the EasyPost API.
