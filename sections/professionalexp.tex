    \begin{itemize} 
    \item Analysed reinforcement learning based resource sharing, offloading and allocation for cloud-edge computing systems.
    \item Developed an approximation for an Mixed-Integer Optimal Matching Algorithm for resource allocation to significantly reduce execution time while achieving similar performance levels.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Research Assistant to Professor Dr. Elliott Ash and worked on improving semantic labelling for text corpora using newer NLP models, sentence simplification and clustering for topic modelling.
    \item Worked on a paraphrase mining project to determine clusters of similar narratives in legal corpora and also using NLP models to capture underlying narratives in meat policy documents and analyse societal impacts and political discourse.

    {\cventry{May 2019 -- July 2019}{Software Development Intern}{Capgemini Engineering}{ Gurgaon, India}{}{%\vspace{3pt} 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Developed a K-Shortest Path Searching algorithm for the ONOS platform in a Java environment, automated and deployed using Maven.
    \item The algorithm was subject to dynamic constraints in terms of network resources such as required edges and vertices etc. and was used for path calculation for deployment in Software Defined Layer 2 VPNs.
