\begin{itemize}
\item Transformer based neural network learn network dynamics and make smarter packet-level decisions.
\item Used both packet and network state features to capture the underlying patterns in network traffic with a task-agnostic pre-training phase.
\item Task-specific fine-tuning phases to leverage learnt behaviour, make quicker, better forwarding decisions.

\begin{itemize}
\item Prototype for a new programmble forwarding node (a Super-Node) for dynamic control over forwarding in Layer-3 networks.
\item Super-Node combines a traditional L3 router's control plane (CP) with a P4 programmable data plane (DP).
\item Accelerated forwarding and network convergence by leveraging the newly combined CP and DP.
