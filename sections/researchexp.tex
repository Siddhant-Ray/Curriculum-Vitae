\begin{itemize}
\item Developed a Transformer based neural network which can efficiently learning network dynamics and make smarter packet-level forwarding decisions.
\item Using features from both the packet and network state, we capture the underlying patterns in the traffic in a task-agnostic pre-training phase followed by task-specific fine-tuning phases to leverage this learnt behaviour, make quicker updates and make better decisions.

\begin{itemize}
\item Created a prototype for a new forwarding node in programmable networks i.e. a Super-Node to have better and more dynamic  control over forwarding decision in Layer-3 (L3) routers.
\item Our Super-Node consists of a traditional L3 router's control plane (CP) combined with a P4 programmable data plane (DP) for forwarding packets and we attempt accelerated forwarding and network convergence by leveraging the newly combined CP and DP.

\begin{itemize}
\item Developed a Transformer based neural network to classify a multi-class hierarchical, context-overlapping news dataset. 
\item Created a new statistical algorithm to detect context overlap in dataset classes, used it to reduce class label redundancy and demonstrated improvements of the classification model based on the algorithm's reduction

\begin{itemize}
\item Proposed a new cell association scheme to meet the ultra low latency, higher load and traffic needs of the 5G networks.
\item Proposed a Hidden Markov Model based learning algorithm followed by a Viterbi based decoding scheme, on the networkâ€™s telemetry data, to learn network parameters and select the optimal eNodeB for cell association.
