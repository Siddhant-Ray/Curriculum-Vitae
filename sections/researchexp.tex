\begin{itemize}
\item Developed a Transformer based model for efficiently learning network dynamics and use this to make better packet forwarding decisions
\item Our model uses features from both the packet and network state to capture the underlying patterns in the traffic in a pre-training phase in a task-agnostic manner
\item We then have a fine-tuning on specific tasks phase to leverage this learnt behaviour, make quicker updates to the model and make better decisions.

\begin{itemize}
\item Created a prototype for a new forwarding node in programmable networks i.e. a Super-Node to make Layer-3(L3) routers more dynamic
\item Our Super-Node consists of a traditional L3 router's control plane(CP) combined with a P4 programmable data plane(DP) for forwarding packets
\item We attempt accelerated forwarding and network convergence by leveraging the compute power of the L3 CP combined with the programmability of the P4 DP

\begin{itemize}
\item Developed a transformer based Neural Network model in order to classify a, multi-class hierarchical, context-overlapping news dataset
\item Created a statistical algorithm to detect overlap in dataset classes, and used it to reduce label redundancy in the original dataset
\item Demonstrated improvements using our same classification model on the improved dataset based on reduction using our algorithm

\begin{itemize}
\item Proposed a new cell association scheme to meet the ultra low latency, load and traffic needs of the 5G networks
\item Proposed a Hidden Markov Model based learning algorithm, on the networkâ€™s telemetry data, which is used to learn network parameters and select the best eNodeB for cell association 
\item  The proposed model uses an HMM learning followed
by Viterbi based decoding scheme for selecting the optimal cell for association
